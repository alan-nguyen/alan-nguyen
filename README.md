### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alan - a self-taught software developer. My first introduction to programming was using Java and I was drawn toward web development. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and building projects. I'm currently strengthening my JS skills and developing my personal projects using React.
